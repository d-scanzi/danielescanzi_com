These are formally defined as *sinusoidal gratings convolved with a Gaussian kernel*. The definition looks scarier than it is. Let's look to a Gabor to understand why\n\nAs you can see, this stimulus is pretty simple, a bunch of black and white stripes that fade along their extremities. *Lines* and *fading* are the key points to understanding the definition. Indeed, we can create a parallel between *lines* and *sinusoidal grating* and between *fading* and *Gaussian kernel*. \n\nTo create a series of black-and-white lines, we can use a sinusoid. Think about this, a sinusoid is a function that fluctuates up and down. We can use it to describe continuous and repeating fluctuations between two states, for instance, between two **opposite** colours, like black and white. To do this, we set that the peak value of the sinusoid represents black, while the trough value black. Everything in between is a graded shade of grey.\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nsamples  <- seq(1, 10, by = 0.0001)\nsinusoid <- sin(2*pi*1*samples)\n\nsimple_sine <- data.frame(x = samples, y = sinusoid) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n    geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n    theme_minimal()\n\ndata.frame(x = samples, y = sinusoid) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x=x, y=y, colour = sinusoid)) +\n    geom_line(size = 1.5) +\n    scale_colour_gradient(low = \"black\", high = \"white\") +\n    theme_minimal()\n\n```\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":{"dark":["cyborg","../../mystyles.scss"],"light":["cyborg","../../cyborg_light.scss"]},"title":"Creating coloured Gabor stimuli with Psychopy","author":"Daniele Scanzi","date":"2023/02/13","description":"How to use Psychopy to create coloured Gabor patches or grating stimuli","categories":["Python","coding","experiments"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
