Specifically, neurons across the cortex must be able to maintain and process information at different time scales: from brief moments necessary to react to a stimulus, to seconds, minutes, and even years, as in working memory and memory. The time scale of different cortical areas was estimated from the PSD of ECoG recordings, exploiting the fact that the time-scale factor can be calculated from the *knee frequency* in the power spectrum. They then correlated the time-scale values with measures of myelination, cortical thickness, gene expression, and working memory performance. They observed that time scales are correlated with all these measures, suggesting that the micro- and macro-scale structural and functional organization of the brain allows for the emergence of an organized time-scale structure. Indeed, sensorimotor and visual areas showed faster time scales, while association regions showed longer time scales, reflecting the different types of information processing they perform. Note that this hierarchy has been observed in both humans and macaques. This time scale also varies as a function of cognitive activity (e.g., time scale increases with increased cognitive load) and aging (on average, the time scale decreases).\n\n## 2024-06-04: [Keesey & Nichols, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042698967900077?via%3Dihub)\n\nThe authors investigate the relationship between the time dynamics of individual [[alpha power]] and the fading out of stabilized fixated images. They used a collimator system mounted on a contact lens to stabilize a patch of light on the participant's retina while recording EEG. They observed that [[alpha power]] increases over a 1-second period before the participant reports the subjective disappearing of the image from conscious perception. [[Alpha power]] decreases after the participant reports the reappearing of the stimulus (though the change in alpha is more variable in time). They also observed that reappearance of the image was preceded by large eye movements or blinks in 40% of the trials. In a control condition where the image was not stabilized and the disappearance of the stimulus was mimicked by either defocusing the stimulus or lowering its luminance to zero, they observed that [[alpha power]] changes only after the participant reports the change in subjective perception. Putting it all together, it seems that [[alpha power]] might control the perception of luminous stimuli when the visual system cannot rely on eye movements to update the retinal image. Here, the authors suggest the possibility that in this condition, alpha replaces the missing signal associated with the visual input.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## 2024-06-05: [Gao et al., 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61277)\n\nIn this paper, Gao and colleagues investigate the *time-scale* property of neurons.
