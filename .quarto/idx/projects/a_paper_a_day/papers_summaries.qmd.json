These observations have been expanded with behavioural analyses to determine whether the detection of a target follows an oscillatory pattern. Here, the authors build on previous studies by estimating behavioural oscillations and relating hit rates to the length of the cue-target interval. Specifically, they compute the hit rate in a 50 ms sliding window to obtain a time-resolved hit-rate measure. The frequency spectrum of the time-resolved hit rate is then computed to investigate whether the behavioural representation of attention deployment is dominated by specific frequencies. However, in this study, they do not observe any effect of frequency on target detection (i.e., detection is not more common at specific delays from cue onset). Similarly, they did not find any oscillatory effects at non-cued locations.\n\n---\n\n## 2024-08-06: [Wei et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-022-09862-7)\n\nThis study employed an uncued lateralised detection task to investigate whether the alpha desynchronisation usually observed in these types of tasks is associated with frontal activity. The assumption is that, although occipital alpha power might play a role in detecting visual stimuli, it could be modulated by frontal activity. They observed that occipital alpha power in the 200ms preceding the stimulus correlates with hits and misses (low power -> hit; high power -> miss). Some results pointed towards a frontal-to-occipital sweep of alpha power correlated with hits and misses, moving from a time window further away from the stimulus towards stimulus presentation (e.g., parieto-central activity correlates with hits and misses around 500ms before stimulus onset). However, these correlations were not significant or approached significance after FDR correction, making this trend difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, they also observed synchronisation between frontal theta activity and occipital alpha power, with this synchronisation being stronger for high alpha power compared to low power. Moreover, occipital power could be predicted by frontal theta power.\n\n## 2024-07-06: [Boncompte et al., 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160347)\n\nStudies on the lateralisation of alpha power commonly use cued designs. However, hypotheses have been made regarding the possibility of this lateralisation being generated non-stochastically. To address this, the authors employed a lateralised design (target appears either in the left or right hemifield) without using a cue. They compared alpha power between seen trials (participant saw the target) and unseen trials (participant missed the target). They observed that, although the overall occipital alpha power preceding target onset remains constant between seen and unseen trials, there is significant lateralisation that distinguishes the two conditions. Specifically, there is higher lateralisation in seen trials (higher power in the ipsilateral hemisphere) compared to unseen trials. The crucial aspect here is that this lateralisation is endogenously driven, as no cues were presented.\n\n## 2024-06-06: [Liu et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008223000333?via%3Dihub)\n\nProbably one of the most reliable observations in attentional studies\n(and working memory) is the lateralization of alpha power â€” a\nmodulation in power so that there is lower power in the hemisphere\ncontralateral to the hemifield where attention was deployed. Here, they\nshow that one potentially important confound is eye movements,\nspecifically microsaccades. These small deviations from\nfixations create a lateralization of occipital alpha power even\nin the absence of a task (here they analyzed the retention period of a\nworking memory paradigm), meaning that microsaccades alone are\nable to drive changes in power. Importantly, they observed that the\ndirection of the alpha power lateralization is such that power\nincreases ipsilateral to the direction of the microsaccades,\nwhile no effects were observable in the contralateral hemisphere.\nMoreover, the effect was greater at P07/P08, but only weak at central\nelectrodes. These observations pose questions about how to properly\ninvestigate the relationship between alpha power and attention\nin lateralized presentations.\n\n## 2024-06-05: [Gao et al., 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61277)\n\nIn this paper, Gao and colleagues investigate the *time-scale* property\nof neurons. Specifically, neurons across the cortex must be able to\nmaintain and process information at different time scales: from brief\nmoments necessary to react to a stimulus, to seconds, minutes, and even\nyears, as in working memory and memory. The time scale of different\ncortical areas was estimated from the PSD of ECoG recordings, exploiting\nthe fact that the time-scale factor can be calculated from the *knee\nfrequency* in the power spectrum. They then correlated the time-scale\nvalues with measures of myelination, cortical thickness, gene\nexpression, and working memory performance. They observed that time\nscales are correlated with all these measures, suggesting that the\nmicro- and macro-scale structural and functional organization of the\nbrain allows for the emergence of an organized time-scale structure.\nIndeed, sensorimotor and visual areas showed faster time scales, while\nassociation regions showed longer time scales, reflecting the different\ntypes of information processing they perform. Note that this hierarchy\nhas been observed in both humans and macaques. This time scale also\nvaries as a function of cognitive activity (e.g., time scale increases\nwith increased cognitive load) and aging (on average, the time scale\ndecreases).\n\n## 2024-06-04: [Keesey & Nichols, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042698967900077?via%3Dihub)\n\nThe authors investigate the relationship between the time dynamics of\nindividual alpha power and the fading out of stabilized fixated\nimages. They used a collimator system mounted on a contact lens to\nstabilize a patch of light on the participant's retina while recording\nEEG.
