However, obtaining a psychometric function usually requires a high number of trials, as the participant's performance needs to be tested multiple times at a variety of stimulus levels. A way around this is to use an adaptive procedure that incorporates the knowledge acquired from previous trials, as well as the experimenters' knowledge, to estimate the psychometric function's parameters more quickly. Here, Watson and Pelli introduce an adaptive staircase (QUEST), which uses a Bayesian framework to speed up the titration process while retaining high estimation accuracy.\n\n### HOLIDAYS\n\n## 2024-13-06:[Shin et al., 2017](https://elifesciences.org/articles/29086)\n\nPre-stimulus beta power has been associated with detection and attention\nin tactile tasks. Generally, increased sustained pre-stimulus power is\nnegatively correlated with detection and attention. However, the authors\nshow that the observed pre-stimulus power likely does not represent\nsustained activity. When single-trial time-frequency activity is\nanalyzed, short bursts of beta activity (beta events) are visible in the\npre-stimulus window. These beta events are not time-locked to a stimulus\nand do not appear to be generated by a rhythmic generator. Thus, their\nnumber and timing vary across trials. Because of this, averaging trials\nin standard analyses creates the illusion of a sustained beta rhythm. By\nanalyzing two MEG human datasets and one intracranial recording in mice,\nthe authors show that the number and timing of the last beta event are\nnegatively correlated with detection and attention: a higher number of\nevents corresponds to lower detection, and the closer the last beta\nevent is to stimulus onset, the lower the detection and attention.\nImportantly, the number of events and the timing of the last event\nindependently affect behavior.\n\n## 2024-12-06: [Voytek & Knight, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322315003546)\n\nOne of the major features of EEG activity is the 1/f slope visible in\nthe power spectrum of the data. Although attention is predominantly\ngiven to the oscillatory activity visible in the spectrum (i.e., peaks),\nthe 1/f slope might contain relevant information reflecting the\nexcitability state and connectivity of neuronal populations. Here, the\nauthors start by considering the complex coupling between extracellular\nlocal field potentials (LFP) and firing rates. Specifically, neuronal\nspiking is modulated by oscillatory LFPs. LFPs modify the membrane\npotentials of postsynaptic neurons, rendering them closer or further\nfrom firing (essentially, LFPs modify the likelihood of a postsynaptic\npotential inducing an action potential). The authors propose that this\nmicro-scale mechanism could be reflected at the meso-scale by\nphase-amplitude coupling, where the amplitude of a signal is modulated\nby the phase of the oscillatory activity the signal is embedded in.\nMoreover, they argue that the effects of LFP activity are reflected in\nthe 1/f slope. When the LFP activity is \"stable\" and oscillatory,\nneurons are more likely to go through an excitability phase, where\naction potentials can be triggered. In this context, a stimulus could\ntrigger a cascade of action potentials in a neuronal population. If this\nhappens, many neurons in the population would quickly fire and enter a\nrefractory period. As this activity is synchronized by the LFP\noscillations, the net refractory period in the population would be\nshort, resulting in a steep 1/f slope (the aperiodic activity seems to\nreflect local population excitation). Conversely, a weak but prolonged\nstimulus would induce a higher degree of noise in the population field,\nas neurons would not be synchronized, thus inducing a non-coordinated\nfiring pattern. The result is a net prolonged state of inhibition of the\npopulation, which is reflected as a flattened spectrum. To conclude, a\nflattened power spectrum could be a sign of decreased coherence across\ncortical areas, as local firing patterns are not synchronized by stable\noscillatory LFP activity. Note, however, that excessive coherence can be\nproblematic too, as it could create a situation where neuronal firing is\nlocked to the LFP, resulting in a feedback process that perpetuates\nitself. Therefore, a certain amount of \"noise,\" defined as firing\ndecoupled from the background carrier frequency, is needed for proper\ncommunication across brain areas.\n\n## 2024-11-06: [Yuasa et al., 2023](https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/90387v1)\n\nPresenting visual stimuli usually induces a decrease in occipital\n\\[\\[alpha power\\]\\], which is believed to represent increased cortical\nexcitation. However, both oscillatory and broadband aperiodic activities\nare affected by the stimuli. Changes in periodic activity power could be\nmasked by changes in aperiodic power (e.g., alpha power might increase,\nbut broadband aperiodic activity might decrease, creating a false null\neffect). To address this, the authors used a retinotopic mapping\nparadigm (checkerboards moving across space) with ECoG. They separated\nthe periodic and aperiodic components and observed that stimulus\npresentation decreases alpha power at electrodes over visual cortical\nareas processing the stimulus. This suggests a retinotopic distribution\nof alpha power. Further analysis with pRF showed that both components\nhave similar pRF centers in the parafovea, but the pRF for alpha power\nis larger than for aperiodic activity. This indicates that stimuli\nreduce alpha power even when presented peripherally, increasing cortical\nexcitability and tuning the cortex to process visual information.\nImportantly, the stimulus drives \\[\\[alpha power\\]\\] changes, not the\nother way around (bottom-up, not top-down).\n\n## 2024-10-06: [van der Werf et al., 2022](file:///home/daniele/Zotero/storage/EXGE8JYC/ejn.html)\n\nElectrophysiological studies have observed that the deployment of\nattention is a rhythmic process, often associated with neuronal\noscillatory activity around 8 Hz. These observations have been expanded\nwith behavioural analyses to determine whether the detection of a target\nfollows an oscillatory pattern. Here, the authors build on previous\nstudies by estimating behavioural oscillations and relating hit rates to\nthe length of the cue-target interval. Specifically, they compute the\nhit rate in a 50 ms sliding window to obtain a time-resolved hit-rate\nmeasure. The frequency spectrum of the time-resolved hit rate is then\ncomputed to investigate whether the behavioural representation of\nattention deployment is dominated by specific frequencies. However, in\nthis study, they do not observe any effect of frequency on target\ndetection (i.e., detection is not more common at specific delays from\ncue onset). Similarly, they did not find any oscillatory effects at\nnon-cued locations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## 2024-08-06: [Wei et al., 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-022-09862-7)\n\nThis study employed an uncued lateralised detection task to investigate\nwhether the alpha desynchronisation usually observed in these types of\ntasks is associated with frontal activity. The assumption is that,\nalthough occipital alpha power might play a role in detecting visual\nstimuli, it could be modulated by frontal activity. They observed that\noccipital alpha power in the 200ms preceding the stimulus correlates\nwith hits and misses (low power -\\> hit; high power -\\> miss). Some\nresults pointed towards a frontal-to-occipital sweep of alpha power\ncorrelated with hits and misses, moving from a time window further away\nfrom the stimulus towards stimulus presentation (e.g., parieto-central\nactivity correlates with hits and misses around 500ms before stimulus\nonset). However, these correlations were not significant or approached\nsignificance after FDR correction, making this trend difficult to\ninterpret. Nevertheless, they also observed synchronisation between\nfrontal theta activity and occipital alpha power, with this\nsynchronisation being stronger for high alpha power compared to low\npower. Moreover, occipital power could be predicted by frontal theta\npower.\n\n## 2024-07-06: [Boncompte et al., 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160347)\n\nStudies on the lateralisation of alpha power commonly use cued designs.\nHowever, hypotheses have been made regarding the possibility of this\nlateralisation being generated non-stochastically. To address this, the\nauthors employed a lateralised design (target appears either in the left\nor right hemifield) without using a cue. They compared alpha power\nbetween seen trials (participant saw the target) and unseen trials\n(participant missed the target). They observed that, although the\noverall occipital alpha power preceding target onset remains constant\nbetween seen and unseen trials, there is significant lateralisation that\ndistinguishes the two conditions. Specifically, there is higher\nlateralisation in seen trials (higher power in the ipsilateral\nhemisphere) compared to unseen trials. The crucial aspect here is that\nthis lateralisation is endogenously driven, as no cues were presented.\n\n## 2024-06-06: [Liu et al., 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008223000333?via%3Dihub)\n\nProbably one of the most reliable observations in attentional studies\n(and working memory) is the lateralization of alpha power — a modulation\nin power so that there is lower power in the hemisphere contralateral to\nthe hemifield where attention was deployed. Here, they show that one\npotentially important confound is eye movements, specifically\nmicrosaccades. These small deviations from fixations create a\nlateralization of occipital alpha power even in the absence of a task\n(here they analyzed the retention period of a working memory paradigm),\nmeaning that microsaccades alone are able to drive changes in power.\nImportantly, they observed that the direction of the alpha power\nlateralization is such that power increases ipsilateral to the direction\nof the microsaccades, while no effects were observable in the\ncontralateral hemisphere. Moreover, the effect was greater at P07/P08,\nbut only weak at central electrodes. These observations pose questions\nabout how to properly investigate the relationship between alpha power\nand attention in lateralized presentations.\n\n## 2024-06-05: [Gao et al., 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/61277)\n\nIn this paper, Gao and colleagues investigate the *time-scale* property\nof neurons. Specifically, neurons across the cortex must be able to\nmaintain and process information at different time scales: from brief\nmoments necessary to react to a stimulus, to seconds, minutes, and even\nyears, as in working memory and memory. The time scale of different\ncortical areas was estimated from the PSD of ECoG recordings, exploiting\nthe fact that the time-scale factor can be calculated from the *knee\nfrequency* in the power spectrum. They then correlated the time-scale\nvalues with measures of myelination, cortical thickness, gene\nexpression, and working memory performance. They observed that time\nscales are correlated with all these measures, suggesting that the\nmicro- and macro-scale structural and functional organization of the\nbrain allows for the emergence of an organized time-scale structure.\nIndeed, sensorimotor and visual areas showed faster time scales, while\nassociation regions showed longer time scales, reflecting the different\ntypes of information processing they perform. Note that this hierarchy\nhas been observed in both humans and macaques. This time scale also\nvaries as a function of cognitive activity (e.g., time scale increases\nwith increased cognitive load) and aging (on average, the time scale\ndecreases).\n\n## 2024-06-04: [Keesey & Nichols, 1967](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042698967900077?via%3Dihub)\n\nThe authors investigate the relationship between the time dynamics of\nindividual alpha power and the fading out of stabilized fixated images.\nThey used a collimator system mounted on a contact lens to stabilize a\npatch of light on the participant's retina while recording EEG. They\nobserved that alpha power increases over a 1-second period before the\nparticipant reports the subjective disappearing of the image from\nconscious perception. Alpha power decreases after the participant\nreports the reappearing of the stimulus (though the change in alpha is\nmore variable in time). They also observed that reappearance of the\nimage was preceded by large eye movements or blinks in 40% of the\ntrials. In a control condition where the image was not stabilized and\nthe disappearance of the stimulus was mimicked by either defocusing the\nstimulus or lowering its luminance to zero, they observed that alpha\npowerchanges only after the participant reports the change in subjective\nperception. Putting it all together, it seems that alpha power might\ncontrol the perception of luminous stimuli when the visual system cannot\nrely on eye movements to update the retinal image. Here, the authors\nsuggest the possibility that in this condition, alpha replaces the\nmissing signal associated with the visual input.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## 2024-07-11: [Watson & Pelli, 1983](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03202828.pdf)\n\nDetection or discrimination tasks often require the estimation of each participant's psychometric function to control behavioral performance to a specific threshold.
