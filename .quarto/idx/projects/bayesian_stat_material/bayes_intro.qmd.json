Talking with other PhD students, we soon realised that many researchers are interested in applying bayesian stats to their projects. However, most students didn't have the opportunity to learn this and feel like learning it alone can be too difficult and time-consuming - a feeling we share too. \nSo, we decided to expand the group to other interested students, and we started a series of weekly meetups. During these we go through the [2022 lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYUykHScxj8&list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN) accompanying the book, we have discussions and work through exercises together. \nThe group has expanded to around 15 people and has become a great opportunity to learn something useful together and create new connections between like-minded people. \n\nIn this section, you can find the slides and material we create to provide direction during the meetups.  \n\n<center><i><b>This project has now been awarded a [Creating Connections Grant](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/students/academic-information/postgraduate-students/doctoral/doctoral-fees-and-money-matters/creating-connections-grant.html) which will help to provide refreshment during the meetups</center></i></b>"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"bayes_intro.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"visual","theme":{"dark":["cyborg","../../mystyles.scss"],"light":["cyborg","../../cyborg_light.scss"]},"title":"Overview"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
