The track follows the Waihāhā River and it offers a nice and easy walk across a variety of vegetation. \n\n```{r}\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nleaflet() %>% \n    addTiles() %>% \n    setView(lat =-38.698258, lng = 175.627927, zoom = 13) %>% \n    addMarkers(lat=-38.695475, lng=175.600927, label = \"Waihāhā hut\", labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"bottom\")) %>% \n    addMarkers(lat=-38.699846, lng=175.681653, label = \"Starting point\", labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"bottom\")) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$OpenTopoMap) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$Stamen.Terrain)\n```\n\n\nWe spent the night at the Waihāhā hut, and the next day, we made our way back to the car. We decided to take the day slow, visiting Kinloch and then relaxing at the Wairakei Terraces. \n\nGiven that the weather was nice and would have remained clear until the next afternoon, we decided to camp out for another night. We headed to the [Kakaho Campsite](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/pureora-forest-park/things-to-do/kakaho-campsite/). The site was desert, we were the only one there. The night was clear, and we got treated to an amazing starry sky while trying to keep warm next to a campfire.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nleaflet() %>% \n    addTiles() %>% \n    setView(lat=-38.564407, lng=175.718658, zoom = 13) %>% \n    addMarkers(lat=-38.564407, lng=175.718658, label = \"Kakaho campsite\", labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"bottom\")) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$OpenTopoMap) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$Stamen.Terrain)\n```\n\nAfter a quite cold night, we packed up and completed the short [Rimu Track Loop](https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/waikato/places/pureora-forest-park/things-to-do/rimu-walk/) within the Pureora Forest. \n\n## Notes for the future\n\n- For winterish camping, source an Italian Army Blanket (or similar) or bring a hot water bottle. The night was fine, but it would have been nicer to have an extra source of warmth.\n- Instant polenta is a great camping food. It packs compact and it's filling. It might be better than pasta. \n- Need to learn some handy knots\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"waihaha_2023_09_04.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":{"dark":["cyborg","../mystyles.scss"],"light":["cyborg","../cyborg_light.scss"]},"title":"Waihāhā hut and Kakaho Campsite"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
