For most people this name means nothing, but this place is probably one of the most important for me. Still today, some of the most important and memories I have comes from there.\n\nMy grandparents used to bring us four up to this mountain every summer. However, this was not just a one day family hike, this was a month-long stay. A month-long stay in a van that my grandfather repourposed as a self-contained van, without running water, toilet or anything else. We slept all together, some years all inside the van, some other years we got a tent on top of it. We collected water from a spring a couple of hundred meters down the road, my grandmother used to cook us with a small gas stove or on a campfire, where some nights we prepared *vin brulé* (the Italian version of mulled wine).\n\nThis place was amazing. It was not popular, there was hardly anyone around, just us, an alpine cow farmer who became a family friend (you see, my grandparents used to bring our parent up here as well when they young) and a couple of people owning a hut up there. Electricity was not a thing, I remember drinking hot chocolate in the hut lighted up by oil lamps.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>% \n    addTiles() %>% \n    setView(lat = 46.00443455631602, lng = 9.59080996857169, zoom = 10) %>% \n    addMarkers(lat = 46.00443455631602, lng = 9.59080996857169, label = \"Piani dell'Avaro (Bergamo)\", labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"bottom\")) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$OpenTopoMap) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$Stamen.Terrain)\n```\n\nSo how do we spend the majority of our time? Well, hiking for hours with my grandfather looking for mushrooms: *boletus pinicola*, *boletus luridus*, *Lactarius deliciosus* (but only if the sape was orange), *mazze di tamburo* (lit. drumsticks, or macrolepiota procera) *amanita vaginata*, *russola virescens*, *russola cyanoxantha* and a few more. These excursions were always fun for us and scary for our parents. The reason? My grandfather never used tracks, we always explored the woods, away from the areas where other people would go. So imagine, I was 6 and I was walking 8 hours next to cliffs or underneath steep woods. Surely a hard work, but fun and rewarding.\n\n::: {layout-nrow=\"2\"}\n![boletus pinicola](images/pinicola.jpg)\n\n![boletus luridus](images/luridus.jpg)\n\n![amanita vaginata](images/amanita.jpg)\n\n![macrolepiota procera](images/mazza.jpg)\n:::\n\nThroughout the years I acquired some specific knowledge. First of all, how to navigate that terrain safely while keeping up with my grandfather. He's a fast walker, something I acquired too. Then, how to recognise good mushrooms (above), from those that we should avoid (*amanita phalloidis*, *amanita muscaria*, *russola emetica*). How to deal without the comforts of our homes for a long time. But most importantly, the love for the mountain and nature.\n\nRecently, I went back home in Bergamo. It was a fantastic time and I managed to squeeze in a few days in the mountains. It was winter there, so found some snow (not as mush as I would have imagined, but still fun). My family and I went up to the *rifugio Vodala* equipped with crampons. After a great lunch, we decided to keep going up and my sister, my cousin (Luca, the one not looking at the camera in the first picture), my mum and I attempted to reach *Cima Timogno*. However, fog started to build up and we needed enough time to go down. So we stopped half way and turned back. I am not really experienced in winter alpine terrain, so that was a nice challenge. It made me want some training and experience in winter alpine excursions.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n\nleaflet() %>% \n    addTiles() %>% \n    fitBounds(lat1 = 45.958126299318124, \n              lat2 = 45.958126299318124,\n              lng1 = 9.976146736166193 - .04, \n              lng2 = 9.976146736166193 + .03) %>% \n    addLabelOnlyMarkers(lat = 45.958126299318124, \n               lng = 9.976146736166193, \n               label = \"Rifugio Vodala\",\n               labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"top\")) %>% \n    addLabelOnlyMarkers(lat = 45.960028816433734, \n               lng = 9.989227032924491, \n               label = \"Cima Timogno - 2099m\",\n               labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"top\")) %>% \n    addLabelOnlyMarkers(lat = 45.97049378658919, \n                        lng = 9.959527949098838,\n                        label = \"Start\",\n                        labelOptions = labelOptions(noHide = T, direction = \"top\")) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$OpenTopoMap) %>% \n    addProviderTiles(provider = providers$Stamen.Terrain)\n```\n\nI also brought my wife up to *Monte Avaro* twice.
