I love spending time in class discussing interesting topics and having conversations with students. It's one of my favourite parts of being a young researcher. I often think about how to be a better educator, set up my tutorials, and create a positive environment in my classes. How can I grab and maintain students' attention (especially at 8.00 am on a Monday)? How can I explore a concept from a different perspective from the one provided in class by professors? How can I create and encourage a class environment without a strict hierarchical structure?\n\nI'm by no means close to implementing my ideal lab time. A time focused on active learning based on challenging but meaningful activities that expand what was covered in class. A time when we, the educators, guide conversations and discussions rather than simply providing information. Part of the cause is definitely my fault for not being able to fully implement and create what I wish my labs would be. The other part is played by the university system not considering laboratories and tutorials that important, which is evident in underfunding for tutors, stagnant teaching material and the lack of feedback we receive. \n\nBecause of this, I have been proactively collecting reviews and feedback from the students in my tutorials. At the end of each semester, I encourage them to constructively review my work as an educator. I do so through an anonymous survey, which I keep short and light, knowing that no one wants to spend much time answering questions, especially when the exam period is approaching. In class, I encourage students to provide any type of feedback, positive or negative, especially negative, as I want to use it as a building block to improve semester through semester. \n\nWe all know that often feedback is not really used to change anything. Most of the time, it is just assessed by the administration to see if some KPIs have been met. I hate that. So, in the name of transparency and self-accountability, I decided to post all the anonymous feedback here (this is clearly stated in the survey). In the page below, I try to summarise the overall reviews, and I address the points I believe are important for me to consider or reply to. \n\n*Disclaimer: I won't censor any comments except those containing private or sensitive information irrelevant to my role as an educator.

About one-sixth retained them to be within the average range, and no one was below average. I believe this is a great benchmark that shows that my classes are (1) positively different or at least similar to other classes and (2) appreciated by students.\n\n---\n\nThe second question asks literally for a grade. I think it could be a cathartic moment being able to grade the person who has been grading your coursework. Moreover, if taken seriously, grading can make you reflect on the way you evaluate experiences. Was something really that good or that bad? Were the tutorials really so dull or so exciting? Maybe I was just tired or maybe I just liked the content but not the delivery.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nquestion_2_percentages <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[2]) %>% \n    replace_na(list(answers=\"Unanswered\")) %>% \n    table() %>% \n    prop.table() %>% \n    as_tibble()\nquestion_2_percentages$answers <- factor(question_2_percentages$answers, levels = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"Unanswered\"))\n\ngrade_plot <- question_2_percentages %>% \n    ggplot(aes(y=question, x=n, fill=answers)) +\n    geom_col(position = \"fill\", width = .15) +\n    geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(n * 100), \"%\")),\n              position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5),\n              size = 4) +\n    labs(fill  =\"\",\n         title = \"What grade do you think I should recieve as a tutor?\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuGn\", direction = -1) +\n    guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1, reverse = T)) +\n    theme(\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\", color=NA),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f4ea\", color=NA),\n        plot.background  = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f4ea\", color=NA),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)\n      ) +\n    scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = .1)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n```\n\n```{r, dev = \"png\", dev.args=list(bg=\"transparent\")}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\ngrade_plot\n```\n\nThe grade aligns with the coarse benchmark above. 87% of students who completed the survey would be happy to grade my work within the A range (A-, A, A+), and over half of these grades are an A+. Although we often dislike skewed distribution, I think this is a good one. There are no grades below a B, so I think I have happily passed my exam for now. \n\n## What students appreciate\n\nNow, we get to the core of the feedback. I will highlight at the top the comments that I think represent the major ideas. Nonetheless, at the end of the section, you can find an exhaustive table with all the feedback.\n\n> You were always super nice and friendly and you always made me feel super comfortable coming to class. I was also never nervous to ask you questions about assignments cause you were always very informative and good with helping.\n\n> You did a great job in tutorials giving people opportunities to ask for help of they needed it and checking to make sure we were on the right track. Also you kept it engaging by relating the various topics and ideas to your own interest and the wider ideas around the topic, encouraging broader thinking about it.\n\n> Tutorials are fun and friendly environments.\n\nThere are three main elements I think students appreciate:\n\n1- The content should be presented differently from the lecturers. This makes the tutorial feel less like a simple repetition and more like an opportunity to learn more and/or understand better.\n\n2- Give people time to ask questions. We all vary with how comfortable we are in asking questions in class. I encourage discussions, debates and questions since the very first tutorial to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable being an active part.\n\n3- Engage. We all agree that listening to one person talking for two hours is boring. So why do this? Showing a more fun and natural side helps create a connection, keep the attention high and make the tutorial time more enjoyable.\n\n> I felt like the tutorials were quite good, maybe trying to put more organisation with our meetings and not just us asking questions and more information being given would be good.\n\nI agree on this point. One of the aspects I need to work more on is structure (more on this in the next session). I do not want to have everything predefined, as this is counterproductive, but I will try to define at the beginning of the tutorial the key areas I will discuss.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false \nappreciation <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[3]) %>% \n    select(answers) %>% \n    rename(Feedback = answers) %>% \n    drop_na()\n\nkbl(appreciation) %>% \n    kable_minimal(c(\"hover\")) %>% \n    scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"400px\")\n    \n```\n\n## What students think I should do better\n\n> Sometimes the discussion time in tutorials felt too long and often we'd finish the task and end up going off task. Maybe less small group discussion and then a longer period for class discussion would have been more to my personal preference, but its not a major issue cause there was normally plenty of time anyway. Occasionally you start to rush when you get excited, which is fun to see but it can lead to us missing certain points sometimes.\n\nI will try next year to have more class discussions and less small group work. A couple more people pointed this out. I believe that small groups would have encouraged people to talk more by reducing the pressure of having to speak out loud in front of everyone. However, doing this takes time that could be used differently.\n\n> Found the we had to rush some tutorials to fit within the 2hr time. Could try changing what info to include / exclude to fit within the 2hrs and no information is rushed. Could spend a little time going over lectures etc.\n\nThis is a fair point. I almost always take the full 2 hours, most likely because I like to digress. As pointed out above, next year I will try to structure each tutorial a bit more. Specifically, I will highlight at the beginning the major point we will discuss, and I will add a recap at the end. However, I will keep some improvisation. I believe that having just a general structure of what to talk about allows for the exploration of topics, concepts and ideas that otherwise won't be addressed. Tutorials, in my view, are not just a recap of the lectures but a moment where we can dive deeper into a topic or create connections across different areas. They are useful to broaden our understanding of the concepts discussed in the lectures and, by doing so, learn the material better.\n\n> Would appreciate more concise marking, and felt marking scores were abit harsh sometimes compared to other students or the feedback received.\n\nGiven the multiple comments appreciating the lengthy feedback on the essays, I will not plan to change this. Assignments and exams are not just a test but an opportunity to improve and gain skills. By providing detailed feedback, students are able to improve their future work. I agree that I can be strict with my marking. This is partly caused by my study background and the way I have been assessed. Partly because I try to mark focusing hardly on the reasoning. That is, I don't see just repeating the content from a book or lectures as being enough for an A+. The reasoning behind an answer is important. Nonetheless, in the class I teach, us tutors try to match our criteria, so if I am being too harsh, other tutors and professors will call me out on this before the marks are finalized.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false \nimprove <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[4]) %>% \n    select(answers) %>% \n    drop_na()\nkbl(improve) %>% \n    kable_minimal(c(\"hover\")) %>% \n    scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"500px\")\n```\n\n## Extra comments\n\nAs my survey is meant to be quick, I leave the opportunity to express other ideas freely.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false \nextra <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[10]) %>% \n    select(answers) %>% \n    drop_na()\n\nkbl(extra) %>% \n    kable_minimal(c(\"hover\")) %>% \n    scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"400px\")\n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nI love teaching.

I agree that I can be strict with my marking. This is partly caused by my study background and the way I have been assessed. Partly because I try to mark focusing hardly on the reasoning. That is, I don't see just repeating the content from a book or lectures as being enough for an A+. The reasoning behind an answer is important. Nonetheless, in the class I teach, us tutors try to match our criteria, so if I am being too harsh, other tutors and professors will call me out on this before the marks are finalized.\n\n```{r}\n#|
