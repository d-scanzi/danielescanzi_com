I love spending time in class discussing interesting\ntopics and having conversations with students. It's one of my favourite\nparts of being a young researcher. I often think about how to be a\nbetter educator, set up my tutorials, and create a positive environment\nin my classes. How can I grab and maintain students' attention\n(especially at 8.00 am on a Monday)? How can I explore a concept from a\ndifferent perspective from the one provided in class by professors? How\ncan I create and encourage a class environment without a strict\nhierarchical structure?\n\nI'm by no means close to implementing my ideal lab time. A time focused\non active learning based on challenging but meaningful activities that\nexpand what was covered in class. A time when we, the educators, guide\nconversations and discussions rather than simply providing information.\nPart of the cause is definitely my fault for not being able to fully\nimplement and create what I wish my labs would be. The other part is\nplayed by the university system not considering laboratories and\ntutorials that important, which is evident in underfunding for tutors,\nstagnant teaching material and the lack of feedback we receive.\n\nBecause of this, I have been proactively collecting reviews and feedback\nfrom the students in my tutorials. At the end of each semester, I\nencourage them to constructively review my work as an educator. I do so\nthrough an anonymous survey, which I keep short and light, knowing that\nno one wants to spend much time answering questions, especially when the\nexam period is approaching. In class, I encourage students to provide\nany type of feedback, positive or negative, especially negative, as I\nwant to use it as a building block to improve semester through semester.\n\nWe all know that often feedback is not really used to change anything.\nMost of the time, it is just assessed by the administration to see if\nsome KPIs have been met. I hate that. So, in the name of transparency\nand self-accountability, I decided to post all the anonymous feedback\nhere (this is clearly stated in the survey). In the page below, I try to\nsummarise the overall reviews, and I address the points I believe are\nimportant for me to consider or reply to.\n\n*Disclaimer: I won't censor any comments except those containing private\nor sensitive information irrelevant to my role as an educator.

About one-sixth retained them to\nbe within the average range, and no one was below average. I believe\nthis is a great benchmark that shows that my classes are (1) positively\ndifferent or at least similar to other classes and (2) appreciated by\nstudents.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe second question asks literally for a grade. I think it could be a\ncathartic moment being able to grade the person who has been grading\nyour coursework. Moreover, if taken seriously, grading can make you\nreflect on the way you evaluate experiences. Was something really that\ngood or that bad? Were the tutorials really so dull or so exciting?\nMaybe I was just tired or maybe I just liked the content but not the\ndelivery.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nquestion_2_percentages <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[2]) %>% \n    replace_na(list(answers=\"Unanswered\")) %>% \n    table() %>% \n    prop.table() %>% \n    as_tibble()\nquestion_2_percentages$answers <- factor(question_2_percentages$answers, levels = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"Unanswered\"))\n\ngrade_plot <- question_2_percentages %>% \n    ggplot(aes(y=question, x=n, fill=answers)) +\n    geom_col(position = \"fill\", width = .15) +\n    geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(n * 100), \"%\")),\n              position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5),\n              size = 4) +\n    labs(fill  =\"\",\n         title = \"What grade do you think I should recieve as a tutor?\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuGn\", direction = -1) +\n    guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1, reverse = T)) +\n    theme(\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\", color=NA),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f4ea\", color=NA),\n        plot.background  = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f4ea\", color=NA),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)\n      ) +\n    scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = .1)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n```\n\n```{r, dev = \"png\", dev.args=list(bg=\"transparent\")}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\ngrade_plot\n```\n\nThe grade aligns with the coarse benchmark above. 87% of students who\ncompleted the survey would be happy to grade my work within the A range\n(A-, A, A+), and over half of these grades are an A+. Although we often\ndislike skewed distribution, I think this is a good one. There are no\ngrades below a B, so I think I have happily passed my exam for now.\n\n## What students appreciate\n\nThere are a few core trends that started to come up over time. Firstly,\nstudents appreciate being in an environment that supports and encourages\nasking questions and sharing thoughts and ideas without worrying. I'm\nvery glad this is a shared sentiment in my classes as this is one of my\npersonal goals towards an ideal cooperative, collaborative and welcoming\nclass.\n\n> I’ve had the pleasure of being in your tutorial stream 2 years in a\n> row and have enjoyed it both times. You encourage discussion so\n> naturally and are incredibly supportive when students share their\n> ideas even if they’re not necessarily the answer you were looking for.\n> I really appreciate the depth with which you explain the lab topics\n> and truly think my learning has been much improved in the lab\n> sessions!\n\n> Support!

Also you kept it engaging by relating the various topics\n> and ideas to your own interest and the wider ideas around the topic,\n> encouraging broader thinking about it.\n\nA second topic seems to be engagement. All those years spent performing\nas a magician are paying back now. I've always treated teaching as a\nmagic act. You need to be able to draw and maintain attention, convey a\nstory and have fun. I always find interesting how some of the most\npopular \"academic\" videos are of professors doing something unexpected\nand interesting. I think we (educators) should all experiment in our\nclasses with the way we present, the way we interact with students and\nthe activities we do.\n\n> You explained all the concepts really well, and often in different\n> ways if we didn't understand.

You are very knowledgeable, helpful and clearly\n> passionate about teaching others about the brain!\n\nA specific reply to the last comment. I totally understand how\nmini-presentations might not be a hit for many people. Public speaking\nsucks, especially when you don't have much time to prepare. However, as\nI said in most of my tutorials, the only way to improve in public\nspeaking is... by publicly speaking. There is no real way around that.\nTo be honest, presentations are not necessarily my own idea, but I hope\nthat by creating a welcoming environment, I'm making them less\nstressful. The way I see it is that tutorials are the perfect\nopportunity to practice presenting, as we are among people we know and\nthere is no judgment involved. I'm glad they helped you with another\npaper!\n\nIndeed, I've just found another fellow student sharing the same\nsentiment. I'll keep this in mind for next year; maybe I'll try to sneak\nsome tips and techniques during the tutorials.\n\n> Integrating mini presentations which helps us build our public\n> speaking and be more confident with our knowledge\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false \nappreciation <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[3]) %>% \n    select(answers) %>% \n    rename(Feedback = answers) %>% \n    drop_na()\n\nkbl(appreciation) %>% \n    kable_minimal(c(\"hover\")) %>% \n    scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"400px\")\n    \n```\n\n## What students think I should do better\n\nIn this section, I will try to reply to some of the comments I believe\nare interesting, or that report sentiments shared by different students.\n\n> I thought you were excellent, the only reason I didn’t give you an A+\n> is because I felt like you could could go even further by dumbing it\n> down and putting course content into other contexts so it would be\n> easier to learn/retain\n\nThis is a great point. Sometimes I'm scared of providing external\ncontext/examples because my areas of expertise and interests are usually\nhighly technical and I don't want to scare people off from a topic.\nHowever, next year I'll do my best to provide external context. Maybe I\ncan get a better sense of everyone's interests and try to also draw from\nthe knowledge of other students in the class. I like the idea of\nstudents helping other students and me understanding something in more\ndetail.\n\n> Maybe instead of presenting in front of the class you could do a group\n> discussion activity instead.\n\n> Sometimes the discussion time in tutorials felt too long and often\n> we'd finish the task and end up going off task.

I tend to lean\ntowards small group discussions because they tend to engage more\nstudents, especially those who are more afraid to talk in front of\neveryone. However, the downside is that people do not get to hear\npossibly interesting thoughts and ideas that have been shared within\nother groups. Next year I will try to (1) add more discussion time and\n(2) shortening the small groups discussions and giving more space to a\nclass discussion. Just one note, as I'm not totally in control of the\nlab material and activities, sometimes it's just not possible to add\nactivities that have not been scheduled by professors. Some professors\nare happy to give us more freedom for how we run the labs, but others\nare stricter and what they want us to do.\n\n> Rather than having us get up and present, make more interactive\n> lessons like the aphantasia ones where we did a little memory test\n> Presentations aren't helpful, there should be another more interactive\n> way. We don't have enough time to do research or to prepare and\n> present and the entire class ends up repeating each other or telling\n> false info.\n\nI don't agree that presentations are not useful (see comment in the\nsection above). However, I agree that tutorials should be more\ninteractive. This is kind of a tricky point to address. I agree with\nyou, there should be more interactive ways to run tutorials. Last year,\nI pushed towards this direction by crafting the simulated EEG-based liar\ndetection activity for PSYCH 305. This year, I created and organized the\nactivity with the portable EEGs. However, I need to strike a balance\nbetween what I would like to do and what the university is happy to\nfund. The two activities above required quite a bit of time to be\norganized, some of which was out of my free time. In the background, I'm\ntrying to push for making psych tutorials real laboratories. However, I\nam not the one making the final decisions nor the one deciding how many\nhours tutors are paid. What I should do, though, is find ways to sneak\nin interactivity during standard tutorials. These activities should be\neasy to organize and incorporate with professors' requirements. I'll\nthink of some ideas during the summer!\n\n> Only suggestion I have is to speak slower.

I totally agree with you all, I know I\nlet myself be taken by the excitement of the topics. Plus, Italians\nspeak fast, so my background does not help. I hope this year I've done a\nbetter job on this. No one pointed this out. If anything, someone\nhighlighted that I have made changes for the best (below). However, I\nhave caught myself speeding up, and it is something I need to pay\nconstant attention to. So I'll leave these comments as a reminder for\nthe next year.\n\n> Nothing!

Were the tutorials really so dull or so exciting?\nMaybe I was just tired or maybe I just liked the content but not the\ndelivery.\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\n\nquestion_2_percentages <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[2]) %>% \n    replace_na(list(answers=\"Unanswered\")) %>% \n    table() %>% \n    prop.table() %>% \n    as_tibble()\nquestion_2_percentages$answers <- factor(question_2_percentages$answers, levels = c(\"A+\", \"A\", \"A-\", \"B+\", \"B\", \"B-\", \"Unanswered\"))\n\ngrade_plot <- question_2_percentages %>% \n    ggplot(aes(y=question, x=n, fill=answers)) +\n    geom_col(position = \"fill\", width = .15) +\n    geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(n * 100), \"%\")),\n              position = position_fill(vjust = 0.5),\n              size = 4) +\n    labs(fill  =\"\",\n         title = \"What grade do you think I should recieve as a tutor?\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"BuGn\", direction = -1) +\n    guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1, reverse = T)) +\n    theme(\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.border = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"transparent\", color=NA),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f4ea\", color=NA),\n        plot.background  = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f4ea\", color=NA),\n        legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = .5)\n      ) +\n    scale_y_discrete(expand = expansion(mult = .1)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\n\n```\n\n```{r, dev = \"png\", dev.args=list(bg=\"transparent\")}\n#| echo: false\n#| message: false\n#| warning: false\ngrade_plot\n```\n\nThe grade aligns with the coarse benchmark above. 87% of students who\ncompleted the survey would be happy to grade my work within the A range\n(A-, A, A+), and over half of these grades are an A+. Although we often\ndislike skewed distribution, I think this is a good one. There are no\ngrades below a B, so I think I have happily passed my exam for now.\n\n## What students appreciate\n\nThere are a few core trends that started to come up over time. Firstly,\nstudents appreciate being in an environment that supports and encourages\nasking questions and sharing thoughts and ideas without worrying. I'm\nvery glad this is a shared sentiment in my classes as this is one of my\npersonal goals towards an ideal cooperative, collaborative and welcoming\nclass.\n\n> I’ve had the pleasure of being in your tutorial stream 2 years in a\n> row and have enjoyed it both times.

All those years spent performing\nas a magician are paying back now. I've always treated teaching as a\nmagic act. You need to be able to draw and maintain attention, convey a\nstory and have fun. I always find interesting how some of the most\npopular \"academic\" videos are of professors doing something unexpected\nand interesting. I think we (educators) should all experiment in our\nclasses with the way we present, the way we interact with students and\nthe activities we do.\n\n> You explained all the concepts really well, and often in different\n> ways if we didn't understand.

You are very knowledgeable, helpful and clearly\n> passionate about teaching others about the brain!\n\nA specific reply to the last comment. I totally understand how\nmini-presentations might not be a hit for many people. Public speaking\nsucks, especially when you don't have much time to prepare. However, as\nI said in most of my tutorials, the only way to improve in public\nspeaking is... by publicly speaking. There is no real way around that.\nTo be honest, presentations are not necessarily my own idea, but I hope\nthat by creating a welcoming environment, I'm making them less\nstressful. The way I see it is that tutorials are the perfect\nopportunity to practice presenting, as we are among people we know and\nthere is no judgment involved. I'm glad they helped you with another\npaper!\n\nIndeed, I've just found another fellow student sharing the same\nsentiment. I'll keep this in mind for next year; maybe I'll try to sneak\nsome tips and techniques during the tutorials.\n\n> Integrating mini presentations which helps us build our public\n> speaking and be more confident with our knowledge\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n#| warning: false\n#| message: false \nappreciation <- raw_feedback %>% \n    filter(question == questions[3]) %>% \n    select(answers) %>% \n    rename(Feedback = answers) %>% \n    drop_na()\n\nkbl(appreciation) %>% \n    kable_minimal(c(\"hover\")) %>% \n    scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"400px\")\n    \n```\n\n## What students think I should do better\n\nIn this section, I will try to reply to some of the comments I believe\nare interesting, or that report sentiments shared by different students.\n\n> I thought you were excellent, the only reason I didn’t give you an A+\n> is because I felt like you could could go even further by dumbing it\n> down and putting course content into other contexts so it would be\n> easier to learn/retain\n\nThis is a great point. Sometimes I'm scared of providing external\ncontext/examples because my areas of expertise and interests are usually\nhighly technical and I don't want to scare people off from a topic.\nHowever, next year I'll do my best to provide external context. Maybe I\ncan get a better sense of everyone's interests and try to also draw from\nthe knowledge of other students in the class. I like the idea of\nstudents helping other students and me understanding something in more\ndetail.\n\n> Maybe instead of presenting in front of the class you could do a group\n> discussion activity instead.\n\n> Sometimes the discussion time in tutorials felt too long and often\n> we'd finish the task and end up going off task. Maybe less small group\n> discussion and then a longer period for class discussion would have\n> been more to my personal preference, but its not a major issue cause\n> there was normally plenty of time anyway.\n\nIndeed, discussions is something I need to work more on. I tend to lean\ntowards small group discussions because they tend to engage more\nstudents, especially those who are more afraid to talk in front of\neveryone. However, the downside is that people do not get to hear\npossibly interesting thoughts and ideas that have been shared within\nother groups. Next year I will try to (1) add more discussion time and\n(2) shortening the small groups discussions and giving more space to a\nclass discussion. Just one note, as I'm not totally in control of the\nlab material and activities, sometimes it's just not possible to add\nactivities that have not been scheduled by professors. Some professors\nare happy to give us more freedom for how we run the labs, but others\nare stricter and what they want us to do.\n\n> Rather than having us get up and present, make more interactive\n> lessons like the aphantasia ones where we did a little memory test\n> Presentations aren't helpful, there should be another more interactive\n> way. We don't have enough time to do research or to prepare and\n> present and the entire class ends up repeating each other or telling\n> false info.\n\nI don't agree that presentations are not useful (see comment in the\nsection above). However, I agree that tutorials should be more\ninteractive. This is kind of a tricky point to address. I agree with\nyou, there should be more interactive ways to run tutorials. Last year,\nI pushed towards this direction by crafting the simulated EEG-based liar\ndetection activity for PSYCH 305. This year, I created and organized the\nactivity with the portable EEGs. However, I need to strike a balance\nbetween what I would like to do and what the university is happy to\nfund. The two activities above required quite a bit of time to be\norganized, some of which was out of my free time. In the background, I'm\ntrying to push for making psych tutorials real laboratories. However, I\nam not the one making the final decisions nor the one deciding how many\nhours tutors are paid. What I should do, though, is find ways to sneak\nin interactivity during standard tutorials. These activities should be\neasy to organize and incorporate with professors' requirements. I'll\nthink of some ideas during the summer!\n\n> Only suggestion I have is to speak slower.

I totally agree with you all, I know I\nlet myself be taken by the excitement of the topics. Plus, Italians\nspeak fast, so my background does not help. I hope this year I've done a\nbetter job on this. No one pointed this out. If anything, someone\nhighlighted that I have made changes for the best (below). However, I\nhave caught myself speeding up, and it is something I need to pay\nconstant attention to. So I'll leave these comments as a reminder for\nthe next year.\n\n> Nothing!
