Studies on the lateralisation of alpha power commonly use cued designs. However, hypotheses have been made regarding the possibility of this lateralisation being generated non-stochastically. To address this, the authors employed a lateralised design (target appears either in the left or right hemifield) without using a cue. They compared alpha power between seen trials (participant saw the target) and unseen trials (participant missed the target). They observed that, although the overall occipital alpha power preceding target onset remains constant between seen and unseen trials, there is significant lateralisation that distinguishes the two conditions. Specifically, there is higher lateralisation in seen trials (higher power in the ipsilateral hemisphere) compared to unseen trials. The crucial aspect here is that this lateralisation is endogenously driven, as no cues were presented.

Probably one of the most reliable observations in attentional studies
(and working memory) is the lateralization of alpha power â€” a
modulation in power so that there is lower power in the hemisphere
contralateral to the hemifield where attention was deployed. Here, they
show that one potentially important confound is eye movements,
specifically microsaccades. These small deviations from
fixations create a lateralization of occipital alpha power even
in the absence of a task (here they analyzed the retention period of a
working memory paradigm), meaning that microsaccades alone are
able to drive changes in power. Importantly, they observed that the
direction of the alpha power lateralization is such that power
increases ipsilateral to the direction of the microsaccades,
while no effects were observable in the contralateral hemisphere.
Moreover, the effect was greater at P07/P08, but only weak at central
electrodes. These observations pose questions about how to properly
investigate the relationship between alpha power and attention
in lateralized presentations.

In this paper, Gao and colleagues investigate the *time-scale* property
of neurons. Specifically, neurons across the cortex must be able to
maintain and process information at different time scales: from brief
moments necessary to react to a stimulus, to seconds, minutes, and even
years, as in working memory and memory. The time scale of different
cortical areas was estimated from the PSD of ECoG recordings, exploiting
the fact that the time-scale factor can be calculated from the *knee
frequency* in the power spectrum. They then correlated the time-scale
values with measures of myelination, cortical thickness, gene
expression, and working memory performance. They observed that time
scales are correlated with all these measures, suggesting that the
micro- and macro-scale structural and functional organization of the
brain allows for the emergence of an organized time-scale structure.
Indeed, sensorimotor and visual areas showed faster time scales, while
association regions showed longer time scales, reflecting the different
types of information processing they perform. Note that this hierarchy
has been observed in both humans and macaques. This time scale also
varies as a function of cognitive activity (e.g., time scale increases
with increased cognitive load) and aging (on average, the time scale
decreases).

The authors investigate the relationship between the time dynamics of
individual alpha power and the fading out of stabilized fixated
images. They used a collimator system mounted on a contact lens to
stabilize a patch of light on the participant's retina while recording
EEG. They observed that alpha power increases over a 1-second
period before the participant reports the subjective disappearing of the
image from conscious perception. Alpha power decreases after the
participant reports the reappearing of the stimulus (though the change
in alpha is more variable in time). They also observed that reappearance
of the image was preceded by large eye movements or blinks in 40% of the
trials. In a control condition where the image was not stabilized and
the disappearance of the stimulus was mimicked by either defocusing the
stimulus or lowering its luminance to zero, they observed that alpha
powerchanges only after the participant reports the change in
subjective perception. Putting it all together, it seems that alpha
power might control the perception of luminous stimuli when the
visual system cannot rely on eye movements to update the retinal image.
Here, the authors suggest the possibility that in this condition, alpha
replaces the missing signal associated with the visual input.
