Electrophysiological studies have observed that the deployment of attention is a rhythmic process, often associated with neuronal oscillatory activity around 8 Hz. These observations have been expanded with behavioural analyses to determine whether the detection of a target follows an oscillatory pattern. Here, the authors build on previous studies by estimating behavioural oscillations and relating hit rates to the length of the cue-target interval. Specifically, they compute the hit rate in a 50 ms sliding window to obtain a time-resolved hit-rate measure. The frequency spectrum of the time-resolved hit rate is then computed to investigate whether the behavioural representation of attention deployment is dominated by specific frequencies. However, in this study, they do not observe any effect of frequency on target detection (i.e., detection is not more common at specific delays from cue onset). Similarly, they did not find any oscillatory effects at non-cued locations.

This study employed an uncued lateralised detection task to investigate whether the alpha desynchronisation usually observed in these types of tasks is associated with frontal activity. The assumption is that, although occipital alpha power might play a role in detecting visual stimuli, it could be modulated by frontal activity. They observed that occipital alpha power in the 200ms preceding the stimulus correlates with hits and misses (low power -> hit; high power -> miss). Some results pointed towards a frontal-to-occipital sweep of alpha power correlated with hits and misses, moving from a time window further away from the stimulus towards stimulus presentation (e.g., parieto-central activity correlates with hits and misses around 500ms before stimulus onset). However, these correlations were not significant or approached significance after FDR correction, making this trend difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, they also observed synchronisation between frontal theta activity and occipital alpha power, with this synchronisation being stronger for high alpha power compared to low power. Moreover, occipital power could be predicted by frontal theta power.

Studies on the lateralisation of alpha power commonly use cued designs. However, hypotheses have been made regarding the possibility of this lateralisation being generated non-stochastically. To address this, the authors employed a lateralised design (target appears either in the left or right hemifield) without using a cue. They compared alpha power between seen trials (participant saw the target) and unseen trials (participant missed the target). They observed that, although the overall occipital alpha power preceding target onset remains constant between seen and unseen trials, there is significant lateralisation that distinguishes the two conditions. Specifically, there is higher lateralisation in seen trials (higher power in the ipsilateral hemisphere) compared to unseen trials. The crucial aspect here is that this lateralisation is endogenously driven, as no cues were presented.

Probably one of the most reliable observations in attentional studies
(and working memory) is the lateralization of alpha power â€” a
modulation in power so that there is lower power in the hemisphere
contralateral to the hemifield where attention was deployed. Here, they
show that one potentially important confound is eye movements,
specifically microsaccades. These small deviations from
fixations create a lateralization of occipital alpha power even
in the absence of a task (here they analyzed the retention period of a
working memory paradigm), meaning that microsaccades alone are
able to drive changes in power. Importantly, they observed that the
direction of the alpha power lateralization is such that power
increases ipsilateral to the direction of the microsaccades,
while no effects were observable in the contralateral hemisphere.
Moreover, the effect was greater at P07/P08, but only weak at central
electrodes. These observations pose questions about how to properly
investigate the relationship between alpha power and attention
in lateralized presentations.

In this paper, Gao and colleagues investigate the *time-scale* property
of neurons. Specifically, neurons across the cortex must be able to
maintain and process information at different time scales: from brief
moments necessary to react to a stimulus, to seconds, minutes, and even
years, as in working memory and memory. The time scale of different
cortical areas was estimated from the PSD of ECoG recordings, exploiting
the fact that the time-scale factor can be calculated from the *knee
frequency* in the power spectrum. They then correlated the time-scale
values with measures of myelination, cortical thickness, gene
expression, and working memory performance. They observed that time
scales are correlated with all these measures, suggesting that the
micro- and macro-scale structural and functional organization of the
brain allows for the emergence of an organized time-scale structure.
Indeed, sensorimotor and visual areas showed faster time scales, while
association regions showed longer time scales, reflecting the different
types of information processing they perform. Note that this hierarchy
has been observed in both humans and macaques. This time scale also
varies as a function of cognitive activity (e.g., time scale increases
with increased cognitive load) and aging (on average, the time scale
decreases).

The authors investigate the relationship between the time dynamics of
individual alpha power and the fading out of stabilized fixated
images. They used a collimator system mounted on a contact lens to
stabilize a patch of light on the participant's retina while recording
EEG. They observed that alpha power increases over a 1-second
period before the participant reports the subjective disappearing of the
image from conscious perception. Alpha power decreases after the
participant reports the reappearing of the stimulus (though the change
in alpha is more variable in time). They also observed that reappearance
of the image was preceded by large eye movements or blinks in 40% of the
trials. In a control condition where the image was not stabilized and
the disappearance of the stimulus was mimicked by either defocusing the
stimulus or lowering its luminance to zero, they observed that alpha
powerchanges only after the participant reports the change in
subjective perception. Putting it all together, it seems that alpha
power might control the perception of luminous stimuli when the
visual system cannot rely on eye movements to update the retinal image.
Here, the authors suggest the possibility that in this condition, alpha
replaces the missing signal associated with the visual input.
