Above average,A,"Interactiveness, enthusiasm and motivation",Nothing really,Enthusiastic,Motivational ,Clear,,,Great job! Thanks for being a great tutor! 
Above average,A,I really loved your passion and the time you took to check everybody understood. Also appreciated when you would draw diagrams to help us understand when we were all struggling to understand.,"Only suggestion I have is to speak slower. Your excitement and English are amazing, but when you speak really fast with excitement, it made it difficult to understand and keep up sometimes. ",Enthusiastic ,Supportive,Friendly,,,"Thanks so much for your help and enthusiasm! I found Psych 305 to be a really difficult class, but having you as a tutor helped me so much with the work content because your excitement made me get more excited about it, which helped me engage and learn better! I really loved having you teach us! All the best. :)"
Above average,A-,I enjoyed the activities we did!! It was fun especially with how the content was pretty full on but the fact we got to discuss often with our peers was a good aspect for me. I also liked how you went through the content first explaining everything we similarly learnt in lectures before we started because hearing it from the way you talked about it helped me understand lecture content a bit easier. And the white board examples and the pictures helped immensely!!!! It made things so much easier to grasp so please continue that because reading of PowerPoint slides for me personally doesnâ€™t feel engaging ,"This isn't really a you thing but it was better communication with the lecturers (not really your fault) as it's kind of disheartening when tutors don't know whata's going on with what lecturers are doing for example when lab quizzes results are released or even whats going on with exams. I also wish we got to discuss with more of our peers around the room, not just the people we sat with but I guess thatâ€™s kind of hard with the layout of the room ",Helpful ,Energetic ,Cool ,,,
Above average,A-,"Engaged with smaller group discussions by walking around the room 
Answered questions directly and was ready to do so in the middle of a presentation",Sometimes skipped over points too quick.,,,,,,
Above average,A+,"Tutorials felt well prepared and always were well delivered, the content was explained clearly and sometimes having clarification of lecture material was super helpful. Your delivery was engaging and even content I'm not super into wasn't boring so thank you! You seem to be pretty into the topics that we covered which really helps. The feedback on the essay was pretty insightful too.  ","Sometimes the discussion time in tutorials felt too long and often we'd finish the task and end up going off task. Maybe less small group discussion and then a longer period for class discussion would have been more to my personal preference, but its not a major issue cause there was normally plenty of time anyway.",engaging,fun,greatatexplainingthings,,,Thanks for a great semester!!
Average,A-,"Trying to engage the class rather than lecturing, despite a lack of input form us ðŸ˜†","Occasionally you start to rush when you get excited, which is fun to see but it can lead to us missing certain points sometimes",Fun,Interesting,,,,

Above average,A,"You were fun and engaging, incredibly knowledgeable about the topics you were teaching, spent time with us one-on-one or in pairs when able and provided individual feedback + guidance","Honestly, thought you were amazing.

Above average,A+,"Everything is explained very well, youâ€™re very patient with answering questions no matter how many are asked or if you get interrupted, you know the content well and relate it to us in a very simple and good way as well, you give us a very nice breakdown of how to write things and what to include in assignments (for the TBI essay) and in general you make it a very nice environment to be in and your chill/relaxed and funny vibe makes the tutorials far more engaging ","Honestly nothing, the way you do things is amazing ",Funny,relaxed,engaging ,,,I'm not actually in your normal stream but joined it once when I couldnâ€™t attend my normal one and I enjoyed your tutorial so much that I made it my regular stream and have been coming along ever since 
Above average,A+,Asked us questions that helped go to actively revise.,Summarise the lab at the end,Engaging,attentive,thorough,,,
Above average,A+,"Support! You were very supportive and accurately explained what was required to do well in this class, and explained what we did not need to know as extensively - which was much appreciated as often times labs can be seen as just an overload of information.","I think maybe the first few labs had a LOT of information to be taught and not so much time for questions to be asked. This isnâ€™t so much a tutor specific issue, rather it is a course coordination issue of how much is taught in those labs",Friendly,Supportive,Cheerful,Approachable,,LOVE YOU DANIELE!!! You are an awesome tutor
Above average,A, i liked how you explained things in a different way to the lecturers which often made more sense to me. or having the content presented in a different way deepened my understanding of it. i liked how you took the time to explain something fully to me again if i still didnâ€™t understand it ,occasionally (not often) i couldnâ€™t understand what you were saying when you spoke fast ,friendly,approachable ,engaging,,,you never gave us the pizza making class :(

Above average,A+,Always have interesting teaching way,Maybe speaking a little bit slower is better ,humorous,passionate,,,,No
Above average,A,Good at explaining thoroughly and gives a real opportunity for students to ask questions. Also answers questions as best as possible. Takes time to check in on each student/group individually and welcoming to ask questions to. Seems like you genuinely want to help your students understand everything clearly and do well. ,"More of feedback for tutorials in general rather than the tutor but Maybe, especially in the first lesson, have more focus on having students introduce themselves in the class and have opportunities to work together and discuss with each other so that students can build relationships to each other and to tutor. ",Genuine, eccentric,amusing,entertaining,passionate,Great mustache! And you did a great job giving students opportunity to ask questions individually (rather than to whole class) so felt more comfortable and open. Thanks!

Above average,A+,Really encouraging and great with positive feedback. I really liked the feedback I received on my assignments throughout the course as it guided me as to how to improve in my work.,"communication could've been better, at times was difficult to get our points across as our research differed greatly from yours, which is completely okay but having a tutor who knows the topic and understands the specific research would have made it a wee bit easier for you and us.",,,,,,Daniele was my tutor for my year 3 capstone course of my degree.
