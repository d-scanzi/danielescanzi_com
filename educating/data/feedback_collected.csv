Above average,A,"Interactiveness, enthusiasm and motivation",Nothing really,Enthusiastic,Motivational ,Clear,,,Great job! Thanks for being a great tutor! 
Above average,A,I really loved your passion and the time you took to check everybody understood. Also appreciated when you would draw diagrams to help us understand when we were all struggling to understand.,"Only suggestion I have is to speak slower. Your excitement and English are amazing, but when you speak really fast with excitement, it made it difficult to understand and keep up sometimes. ",Enthusiastic ,Supportive,Friendly,,,"Thanks so much for your help and enthusiasm! I found Psych 305 to be a really difficult class, but having you as a tutor helped me so much with the work content because your excitement made me get more excited about it, which helped me engage and learn better! I really loved having you teach us! All the best. :)"
Above average,A-,I enjoyed the activities we did!! It was fun especially with how the content was pretty full on but the fact we got to discuss often with our peers was a good aspect for me. I also liked how you went through the content first explaining everything we similarly learnt in lectures before we started because hearing it from the way you talked about it helped me understand lecture content a bit easier. And the white board examples and the pictures helped immensely!!!! It made things so much easier to grasp so please continue that because reading of PowerPoint slides for me personally doesnâ€™t feel engaging ,"This isn't really a you thing but it was better communication with the lecturers (not really your fault) as it's kind of disheartening when tutors don't know whata's going on with what lecturers are doing for example when lab quizzes results are released or even whats going on with exams. I also wish we got to discuss with more of our peers around the room, not just the people we sat with but I guess thatâ€™s kind of hard with the layout of the room ",Helpful ,Energetic ,Cool ,,,
Above average,A-,"Engaged with smaller group discussions by walking around the room 
Answered questions directly and was ready to do so in the middle of a presentation",Sometimes skipped over points too quick.,,,,,,
Above average,A+,"Tutorials felt well prepared and always were well delivered, the content was explained clearly and sometimes having clarification of lecture material was super helpful. Your delivery was engaging and even content I'm not super into wasn't boring so thank you! You seem to be pretty into the topics that we covered which really helps. The feedback on the essay was pretty insightful too.  ","Sometimes the discussion time in tutorials felt too long and often we'd finish the task and end up going off task. Maybe less small group discussion and then a longer period for class discussion would have been more to my personal preference, but its not a major issue cause there was normally plenty of time anyway.",engaging,fun,greatatexplainingthings,,,Thanks for a great semester!!
Average,A-,"Trying to engage the class rather than lecturing, despite a lack of input form us ðŸ˜†","Occasionally you start to rush when you get excited, which is fun to see but it can lead to us missing certain points sometimes",Fun,Interesting,,,,

Above average,A,"You were fun and engaging, incredibly knowledgeable about the topics you were teaching, spent time with us one-on-one or in pairs when able and provided individual feedback + guidance","Honestly, thought you were amazing.

Above average,A+,"Support! You were very supportive and accurately explained what was required to do well in this class, and explained what we did not need to know as extensively - which was much appreciated as often times labs can be seen as just an overload of information.","I think maybe the first few labs had a LOT of information to be taught and not so much time for questions to be asked. This isnâ€™t so much a tutor specific issue, rather it is a course coordination issue of how much is taught in those labs",Friendly,Supportive,Cheerful,Approachable,,LOVE YOU DANIELE!!! You are an awesome tutor
Above average,A, i liked how you explained things in a different way to the lecturers which often made more sense to me. or having the content presented in a different way deepened my understanding of it. i liked how you took the time to explain something fully to me again if i still didnâ€™t understand it ,occasionally (not often) i couldnâ€™t understand what you were saying when you spoke fast ,friendly,approachable ,engaging,,,you never gave us the pizza making class :(

Above average,A,Good at explaining thoroughly and gives a real opportunity for students to ask questions. Also answers questions as best as possible. Takes time to check in on each student/group individually and welcoming to ask questions to. Seems like you genuinely want to help your students understand everything clearly and do well. ,"More of feedback for tutorials in general rather than the tutor but Maybe, especially in the first lesson, have more focus on having students introduce themselves in the class and have opportunities to work together and discuss with each other so that students can build relationships to each other and to tutor. ",Genuine, eccentric,amusing,entertaining,passionate,Great mustache! And you did a great job giving students opportunity to ask questions individually (rather than to whole class) so felt more comfortable and open. Thanks!

Above average,A+,Really encouraging and great with positive feedback. I really liked the feedback I received on my assignments throughout the course as it guided me as to how to improve in my work.,"communication could've been better, at times was difficult to get our points across as our research differed greatly from yours, which is completely okay but having a tutor who knows the topic and understands the specific research would have made it a wee bit easier for you and us.",,,,,,Daniele was my tutor for my year 3 capstone course of my degree. He was an amazing communicator who was ways able to convey feedback in an depth manner - because of this I was motivated improve my work rather than seeing it as a daunting task.

Above average,A+,"Daniele was very engaging during class. Although the class is an 8am tutorial, he was quite energetic and engaging and that really helped. He was very informative and if we said wrong information he kindly corrected what we said and taught well. As I donâ€™t attend lectures often, these tutorials summarised the content well and helped me to make sense of lecture content when I eventually got around to watching them. There was a time where he allowed us to work by ourselves if we wanted and that was really kind.",Nothing at all I can think of,Understanding,Informative ,Helpful,,,Honestly really amazing tutor/lab instructor!!

Above average,A-,I liked all the resources you gave us at the beginning. Youâ€™re also very knowledgeable and engaging ,"I thought you were excellent, the only reason I didnâ€™t give you an A+ is because I felt like you could could go even further by dumbing it down and putting course content into other contexts so it would be easier to learn/retain",Smart,,,,,I agree with content being more practical. I feel like we learn about other research but not how to action it. I feel unprepared for post grad because all my research knowledge comes from lecture slides or one topic for my essay. 
Above average,A+,Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of being in your tutorial stream 2 years in a row and have enjoyed it both times. You encourage discussion so naturally and are incredibly supportive when students share their ideas even if theyâ€™re not necessarily the answer you were looking for. I really appreciate the depth with which you explain the lab topics and truly think my learning has been much improved in the lab sessions!,Nothing! I think you truly have taken into account feedback from previous years (or perhaps I am just used to your teaching style) and itâ€™s been great. ,Vibrant,Supportive,Knowledgeable ,,,"While I do enjoy the more practical labs as a change of pace, I think that rehashing the lecture content in more detail and really parsing out the information is super valuable and helpful."
