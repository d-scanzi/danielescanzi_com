Above average,A,"Interactiveness, enthusiasm and motivation",Nothing really,Enthusiastic,Motivational ,Clear,,,Great job! Thanks for being a great tutor! 
Above average,A,I really loved your passion and the time you took to check everybody understood. Also appreciated when you would draw diagrams to help us understand when we were all struggling to understand.,"Only suggestion I have is to speak slower. Your excitement and English are amazing, but when you speak really fast with excitement, it made it difficult to understand and keep up sometimes. ",Enthusiastic ,Supportive,Friendly,,,"Thanks so much for your help and enthusiasm! I found Psych 305 to be a really difficult class, but having you as a tutor helped me so much with the work content because your excitement made me get more excited about it, which helped me engage and learn better! I really loved having you teach us! All the best. :)"
Above average,A-,I enjoyed the activities we did!! It was fun especially with how the content was pretty full on but the fact we got to discuss often with our peers was a good aspect for me. I also liked how you went through the content first explaining everything we similarly learnt in lectures before we started because hearing it from the way you talked about it helped me understand lecture content a bit easier. And the white board examples and the pictures helped immensely!!!! It made things so much easier to grasp so please continue that because reading of PowerPoint slides for me personally doesn’t feel engaging ,"This isn't really a you thing but it was better communication with the lecturers (not really your fault) as it's kind of disheartening when tutors don't know whata's going on with what lecturers are doing for example when lab quizzes results are released or even whats going on with exams. I also wish we got to discuss with more of our peers around the room, not just the people we sat with but I guess that’s kind of hard with the layout of the room ",Helpful ,Energetic ,Cool ,,,

Your delivery was engaging and even content I'm not super into wasn't boring so thank you! You seem to be pretty into the topics that we covered which really helps. The feedback on the essay was pretty insightful too.  ","Sometimes the discussion time in tutorials felt too long and often we'd finish the task and end up going off task. Maybe less small group discussion and then a longer period for class discussion would have been more to my personal preference, but its not a major issue cause there was normally plenty of time anyway.",engaging,fun,greatatexplainingthings,,,Thanks for a great semester!!

Above average,A+,"Support! You were very supportive and accurately explained what was required to do well in this class, and explained what we did not need to know as extensively - which was much appreciated as often times labs can be seen as just an overload of information.","I think maybe the first few labs had a LOT of information to be taught and not so much time for questions to be asked. This isn’t so much a tutor specific issue, rather it is a course coordination issue of how much is taught in those labs",Friendly,Supportive,Cheerful,Approachable,,LOVE YOU DANIELE!!! You are an awesome tutor
Above average,A, i liked how you explained things in a different way to the lecturers which often made more sense to me. or having the content presented in a different way deepened my understanding of it. i liked how you took the time to explain something fully to me again if i still didn’t understand it ,occasionally (not often) i couldn’t understand what you were saying when you spoke fast ,friendly,approachable ,engaging,,,you never gave us the pizza making class :(

Takes time to check in on each student/group individually and welcoming to ask questions to. Seems like you genuinely want to help your students understand everything clearly and do well. ,"More of feedback for tutorials in general rather than the tutor but Maybe, especially in the first lesson, have more focus on having students introduce themselves in the class and have opportunities to work together and discuss with each other so that students can build relationships to each other and to tutor. ",Genuine, eccentric,amusing,entertaining,passionate,Great mustache!

Above average,A+,Really encouraging and great with positive feedback. I really liked the feedback I received on my assignments throughout the course as it guided me as to how to improve in my work.,"communication could've been better, at times was difficult to get our points across as our research differed greatly from yours, which is completely okay but having a tutor who knows the topic and understands the specific research would have made it a wee bit easier for you and us.",,,,,,Daniele was my tutor for my year 3 capstone course of my degree. He was an amazing communicator who was ways able to convey feedback in an depth manner - because of this I was motivated improve my work rather than seeing it as a daunting task.

He was very informative and if we said wrong information he kindly corrected what we said and taught well.

Above average,A-,I liked all the resources you gave us at the beginning. You're also very knowledgeable and engaging ,"I thought you were excellent, the only reason I didn't give you an A+ is because I felt like you could could go even further by dumbing it down and putting course content into other contexts so it would be easier to learn/retain",Smart,,,,,I agree with content being more practical. I feel like we learn about other research but not how to action it. I feel unprepared for post grad because all my research knowledge comes from lecture slides or one topic for my essay. 
Above average,A+,I've had the pleasure of being in your tutorial stream 2 years in a row and have enjoyed it both times. You encourage discussion so naturally and are incredibly supportive when students share their ideas even if they're not necessarily the answer you were looking for.

Above average,A,I appreciate the energy and getting people to actually discuss things. ,Just teach what you want to as long as it follows the overall tutorial theme—don’t get caught up in the boring slides or poorly planned tutorials—that’s the problem with all the other 200 tutorials. ,Friendly ,Engaging ,Genuine ,,,
Above average,A+,"I thought you were an awesome tutor in how thorough you were in breaking things down to an understandable and relatable level. I also appreciated how open you were in creating class discussions and listening to everyone’s point of views and taking them on board or expanding where there was any confusion. I thought it was great that you even asked as a lab how we most effectively learnt things as individually, and if there needed to be any adjustments in the delivery or process of your teaching. I found that integrating questions and making us think about the topic or slide you were talking about was helpful for me personally. It was fun and obvious you cared about making the lab worthwhile and teaching :) ","I think if there were ways to link ideas or correlations between the different labs/lab topics even more that would be useful for revision or making connections. Although you did already do this to a degree, it's the only feedback I can think of. Maybe more case studies like the documentary, but also with practical elements involved or integrating clinical neuroanatomy outcomes? I found in my other science courses when there is practical process like observing through a microscope or colour changes/fluorescence in a test tube, it helps me link the theory to what I'm seeing and remember or understand the theory behind it more.

Above average,A+,"Energy - which is hard to achieve in an 8am class! But concepts are always explained with energy and enthusiasm.
2) Positive tutor-student relationships. Students feel comfortable to ask for help when stuck on something.
3) Clarity of the instructions given. The labs often involve software that students are not familiar with and that have many steps to follow. These instructions are given clearly and the important parts emphasised/repeated, and help given if anyone gets stuck.","When thinking about the lab content, I realise I do have areas where I'm less confident in if I were being examined. 
All the theory work and explanations support the lecture content well and in this area I feel confident being examined on. However, when it comes to the lab activities working with the software etc., I realise that if this was on the exam, I wouldn’t pass! 
Potentially, what might help future students is showing rather than doing when a student gets stuck. Also, explaining the ‘why’ behind steps so that students can learn what exactly they’re doing and how to problem solve for themselves.",Fun & understanding,Excellent communicator,Highly knowledgeable ,,,"I genuinely agree about having the labs be more activity-based rather than lecture recaps. Labs are the only opportunity students get to use the software that in future jobs many students will be expected to know how to use. The labs are not recorded, so the time in-lab is extremely valuable. Whereas lecture content can always be watched later if it was missed in-person! Additionally, if the lecture portion of lab time is reduced this would allow more time to learn the ‘why’ behind each step of what to do in the activities - rather than rushing through to finish on time."
