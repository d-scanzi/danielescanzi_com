## Is Wally there?

![](img/where_is_wally_intro.jpg) 

Here is a fun experiment. I show you a picture from the puzzle *Where is Wally?* and you need to tell me, as quickly as possible, whether Wally is in there or not. That's correct, I don't want to know where Wally is - that's the standard game - I want to know if he's present in the picture. You can give me only two possible answers "YES" or "NO" and your time is limited.

Click on the [link here](https://rpubs.com/Scanzi_D/iswallyhere) and write down your answer for each image (or just answer in the moment, there are no solutions for this small example).

You should that found that some trials where straightforward - most likely you found Wally immediately. Some trials were difficult (like the image above) - you were completely lost. Some other trials were tricky - you think you answered correctly, but you are unsure.
