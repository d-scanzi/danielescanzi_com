    "The goal of today's lab meeting is to gain insight into the most common EEG data cleaning (preprocessing) steps. I'm going to use MNE (Python) for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we will introduce an alternative to MATLAB in the hope that we can all move away from it for our studies. Secondly, because the point of today is not to learn the \"how-to\" preprocess data (how to make a script, what functions to use, how to code, etc...). I believe that is the easiest part, and there are many tutorials around. Instead, we will try to gain a deeper understanding of what we are doing to the data every time we perform specific cleaning steps. I believe this is a more interesting and useful approach, especially in an hour. \n",

    "## Downsampling\n",
    "\n",
    "If the EEG data was collected with a high sample rate (commonly 1000 Hz), then you can decide to downsample the data to a lower sampling rate, like 500 Hz or 250 Hz. To my understanding, the primary reason for downsampling is to reduce the size of the data and speed up the analyses. This was especially important back in the days when computers did not have much memory and computing power. In my opinion, nowadays, this is not really necessary as most computers are able to handle large datasets. Moreover, by downsampling, we remove some information from the data. Unless downsampling is necessary (e.g. it would take months for your PC to preprocess your data), then I would not do it. However, some online discussions suggest that downsampling might be useful to obtain a better ICA decomposition (I don't think this has been formally tested). \n",

    "This is an essential step, but I think it's probably one of the most technical and complex topics in signal processing. Filtering aims to remove parts of the data that are likely to contain artefacts or not to represent brain activity. For the sake of simplicity, we will only discuss *high-pass filters* and *low-pass filters*without stopping on any specific type of filter (eg. Finite Impulse Response vs Infinite Impulse Response). What we will introduce, though, are some of the parameters you will definitely encounter and will be relevant to your data. \n",
